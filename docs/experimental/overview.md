# Overview

Experimental is a subset of tools that are not fully operational. They can still help you in your daily tasks and allow
them to try new things with zio-spark.

For the moment there is three main experimentation in progress:
- Pipeline => A structure to describe a Spark pipeline with ease
- CancelableEffect => Allows Spark pipeline to be cancelable in ZIO
- MapWithEffect => Allows Spark to run effect for each lines of a RDD
