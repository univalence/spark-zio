# Overview

The sql package provides all the code to interact with Dataset and DataFrame using zio-spark.

It contains essentially, the wrapper around the DataFrameReader, DataFrameWriter, SparkSession and Dataset. 
Since we tried to be as close as possible to the Spark API, it is not useful to write documentations about the Spark 
wrappers, we advise you to look at [Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/).

However, it also contains some zio-spark specific features, that can help you build better pipelines and are documented 
here.
